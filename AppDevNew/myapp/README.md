# Mobile App
This is a cross-platform app made in flutter designed so that even common people can take part in Clean India Movement , the conept of app is simple people can upload images of uncleaned areas near their locality     
       
Images coming from app as well as drones will be grouped daily by our servers in areas of radius 10km2 so that nearby NGOs and Municipal cooperations can clean them as fast as possible    
  
User will also be getting points based on number of images of uncleaned areas he is clicking     
    
We have functionality to not allow user to upload images again from same area so the point that user can upload same area again is not valid    

And users will only be able to upload images from Camera from our app in production mode    

Beside that user can see nearby NGOs and contact them throught he app itself and can also contact us in case of any query with the app only
